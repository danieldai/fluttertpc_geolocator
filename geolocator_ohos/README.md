This project is based on [flutter_geolocator_ohos@1.0.0](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_geolocator_ohos/versions/1.0.0).

## 1. Installation and Usage

### 1.1 Installation

Go to the project directory and add the following dependencies in pubspec.yaml

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluttertpc_geolocator:
    git:
      url: https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/fluttertpc_geolocator.git
      path: "geolocator"
      ref: br_v14.0.1_ohos
  flutter_geolocator_ohos:
    git:
      url: "https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/fluttertpc_geolocator.git"

<!-- tabs:end -->

### 1.2 Usage

For use cases [geolocator_ohos/example](./geolocator_ohos/example/)

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Compatibility

This document is verified based on the following versions:

1. Flutter: 3.7.12-ohos-1.1.1; SDK: 5.0.0(12); IDE: DevEco Studio: 5.0.13.200; ROM: 5.1.0.120 SP3;

### 2.2 **Permission Requirements**

The following permissions include the `system_basic` permission, but the default application permission is `normal`. Only the `normal` permission can be used. Therefore, the error **9568289** may be reported during the installation of the HAP package. For details, see [Document](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/bm-tool-V5#EN_TOPIC_0000001884757326__安装hap时提示code9568289-error-install-failed-due-to-grant-request-permissions-failed) Change the application level to `system_basic`.

#### 2.2.1 **Add permissions to the module.json5 file in the entry directory.**

Open `entry/src/main/module.json5` and add the following information:

```diff
"requestPermissions": [
      {"name" :  "ohos.permission.INTERNET"},
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.LOCATION",
        "reason": "$string:location",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.LOCATION_IN_BACKGROUND",
        "reason": "$string:locationbackground",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.APPROXIMATELY_LOCATION",
        "reason": "$string:locationapprox",
        "usedScene": {
          "abilities": [
            "FormAbility"
          ],
          "when": "inuse"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ohos.permission.KEEP_BACKGROUND_RUNNING",
      },
    ]
```

#### 2.2.2 **Add the reason for applying for the preceding permission to the entry directory.**

Open `entry/src/main/resources/base/element/string.json` and add the following information:

```diff
{
  "string": [
    {
      "name": "location",
      "value": "use location"
    },
    {
      "name": "locationbackground",
      "value": "use locationbackground"
    },
    {
      "name": "locationapprox",
      "value": "use locationapprox"
    }
  ]
}
```
